*Coins to add on your watchlist*

Here on this post I shared a list of long term coins which are well known for their strong fundamentals

DOT, BNB, SNX, FTT, CAKE

If you missed out and/or prefer to buy lower figure coins with strong fundamentals too then here’s a list of coins and exchanges you can get them

CET - CoinEx
VET - Binance
C98 - Binance 
OOE - CoinEx
CRO - Kucoin
FTM - Binance
BAKE - Binance


Remember, “long term” here means that you’re willing to hodl these coins and give them time to grow

Which is why we concentrate on coins with actual and high demand, utility, good team performance, reasonable supply (which of course can be swallowed by the demand) and other fundamentals

Always do your research, follow up their social media pages especially on Twitter for updates

*So Look for good entries, you can buy with ladder entries or DCA since you’re holding for long term*

*DO NOT FOMO*
